Change Log
==========

Version 0.15 *(TBD)*
------------------
  * API break: Presenter#onDestroy and Scoped#onDestroy are now scopeDestroyed(MortarScope).
    Also adds onRegistered(MortarScope) to those classes.

Version 0.14 *(2014-04-18)*
------------------
  * Refine deferral of calls to Bundler#onLoad from MortarActivityScope#onRegister.
    See onRegister javadoc for details.

Version 0.13 *(2014-04-17)*
------------------
  * Fix accidental bundling of dagger-compiler

Version 0.12 *(2014-04-09)*
------------------
  * Guarantees that parent scopes will make their onLoad calls before children.
  * API break: MortarContext has been removed.  Activities must be careful to
    override getSystemService(); see the samples. This change allows
    Mortar to coexist peacefully with other ContextWrappers.

Version 0.11 *(2014-04-03)*
----------------------------
  * Presenter#onDestroy calling dropView was a bad, bad idea. Now it does
    nothing. Drop your own damn views.
  * MortarScopeDevHelper now dumps in alphabetical order, tests pass under 
    Java 8 

Version 0.10 *(2014-04-01)*
----------------------------
  * Fixes PopupPresenter state saving
  * Presenter#onDestroy wasn't calling dropView, does now.

Version 0.9 *(2014-03-28)*
----------------------------
  * Fixes redundant calls to Presenter#onLoad
  * Improved flow owner view in sample code
  * Fixes for redundant Bundler#onLoad calls when registering during onCreate
  * Better diagnostic dumps

Version 0.8 *(2014-03-03)*
----------------------------
  * Fixes bug with bundle key namespacing in presenters.

Version 0.7 *(2014-01-30)*
----------------------------
  * API break: MortarActivityScope#onResume is gone, and as you might expect
    Bundler#onLoad is not called at resume time. It just wasn't useful. See
    ChatScreen in the sample to see how to to handle pausing.

  * API break: Presenter is no longer a Bundler, and its onLoad method
    is never called with a null view.

  * New: Mortar#createRootScope(boolean) for simpler root scope creation.

  * New: Hello Mortar sample app.

Version 0.6 *(2014-01-20)*
----------------------------
  * API break: Mortar#createRootActivityScope is not practical, dropped

  * API break: Presenter#dropView now takes the dropped view as an argument,
    and is expected to be called by outgoing views. Presenter#view
    is no longer a weak reference.

Version 0.5 *(2014-01-21)*
----------------------------
  * API break: Simplified Presenter API, HasMortarScope renamed MortarContext and need not
    be implemented by view classes

  * API break: Root scope can belong to an activity, root ObjectGraph to be passed in.

Version 0.2 *(2013-11-12)*
----------------------------

Initial release.
